-- | A `VectorSpace` v over a field f of "scalars" is a type with an
-- | addition operation <> which makes v a `Group`, and a scalar multiplication
-- | operation `scalarMul` or *< for multiplying a vector by a scalar.
-- |
-- | In addition to the relevant `Group` and `Field` laws, a `VectorSpace` must
-- | satisfy the following laws:
-- |
-- | ```text
-- | x *< (y *< v) = (x * y) *< v
-- | one *< v = v
-- | x *< (u <> v) = (x *< u) <> (x *< v)
-- | (x + y) *< u = (x *< u) <> (y *< v)
-- | ```

-- | Any `Field` forms a vector space over itself. For some field F, this
-- | vector space is often written as F^1.
